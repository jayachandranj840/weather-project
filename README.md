Project Title: Weather App
Overview
The Weather App is a Node.js application that fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it on a web page. This README will guide you through setting up, configuring, and running the project.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js: You can download and install Node.js from nodejs.org.
Installation Steps
Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository from GitHub using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

bash:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
Replace your-username with your GitHub username.

Navigate to the Project Directory

Change into the project directory:

bash:
cd weather-app
Install Dependencies

Install the necessary Node.js dependencies defined in package.json:

bash:
npm install
This command will download and install the required packages, including express and axios.

Configuration
Before running the application, you need to configure your OpenWeatherMap API key in the server.js file:

Obtain an API Key

Sign up on openweathermap.org to obtain an API key. It's free for basic usage.

Replace API Key

Open server.js in a text editor and locate the following line:

javascript:
const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"; // Replace with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key
Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap.

Usage
To run the Weather App:

Start the Server

Run the Node.js application using the following command:
node server.js
This command starts the server and listens on port 3000 by default.

Access the Application

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to view the weather for the default city (London).

Customize City

Enter the name of a city in the input form provided on the web page.
Click on the "Get Weather" button to fetch and display the weather for that city.
Features
Dynamic Weather Display: Fetches current weather data (temperature and description) from OpenWeatherMap.
Error Handling: Handles API request timeouts and retries using a retry mechanism.
Interactive Web Interface: Utilizes Express.js for serving web pages and Axios for making HTTP requests.
